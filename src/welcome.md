# Welcome!

My name is Tim Whitaker and I'm a computer scientist studying artificial intelligence. I started pursuing my PhD in the spring of 2020 where I became fascinated with neural networks. I quickly found that it can be hard to get your bearings in a field as broad and deep as this one, so I started building this website as a digital museum of sorts. Have a look around and enjoy!
